\section*{AI Use Report}

\noindent
In the preparation of this paper, artificial intelligence (AI) tools were used solely as
\textit{auxiliary support tools} to assist with language organization, structural refinement,
and consistency checking. The use of AI tools did \textbf{not} replace any part of the
mathematical modeling, data analysis, computational implementation, or result interpretation
conducted by the team.

\medskip
\noindent
Specifically, AI tools were used for the following purposes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assisting with English language polishing and improving clarity and coherence of written expressions;
  \item Providing suggestions on LaTeX formatting and structural organization of the paper;
  \item Helping to summarize and restate model descriptions and results based strictly on outputs generated by the team;
  \item Supporting logical consistency checks of explanations without introducing new assumptions or results.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent
All mathematical models, assumptions, parameter selections, data preprocessing procedures,
algorithm implementations, numerical experiments, figures, tables, and conclusions were
\textbf{independently designed, implemented, and verified by the team}. No AI tool was used
to generate raw data, perform numerical computation, determine model structure, or make
substantive analytical decisions.

\medskip
\noindent
The team takes full responsibility for the originality, correctness, and integrity of the
models and results presented in this paper. The use of AI tools strictly complies with the
competition requirements and academic integrity standards.
